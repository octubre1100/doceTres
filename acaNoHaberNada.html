    <h1 style="font-size: 48px;">Its going down now</h1>

    <div class="container-fluid textin">
        <p>It's those unintelligent monsters, ain't it?<br>
            What are they thinking? Please explain it<br>
            Don’t really need this crap, can't waste time<br>
            What I possess can’t copy and paste<br>
            I'm doing it better<br>
            Never settling for another regular<br>
            Letter to my enemies, hey I'm telling ya<br>
            Breaking you down to the level of molecular<br>
            Better be wise when you're choosing battles <br>
            it's mostly babbles <br>
            you know one of those big time shady foe foes<br>
            ain’t worth fighting for<br>
            Drop these bars in my sleep, and a few more tricks up my sleeve<br>
            It's way too late for you to leave now (get ready)<br></p>

        <p>
            Disturbing the peace <br>
            Look into my eyes<br>
            Now tell me the things you blabbing about behind my back<br>
            The tenacity I hold, it's hard to break down<br>
            It's too late for apologies<br>
            It's going down now<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You're thirsty for blood<br>
            Actually craving for love<br>
            What you only want is dub<br>
            Greed makes you go numb<br>
            Purposefully blocking good thoughts<br>
            Hey please doctor doctor<br>
            He’s about to be that patient<br>
            Cause I’m about to knock him out cold (bring him back please)<br>
            Whole lotta moves I make on you like dance floor <br>
            and during this beat down<br> you prolly wish that you can
            fast-forward (oh!)<br>
            Don’t you worry about it, I'll save some room for your last words (make sure of it)<br>
            After I do this, do that and the third<br>
        </p>
        Disturbing the peace<br>
        Look into my eyes<br>
        Now tell me the things you blabbing about behind my back<br>
        The tenacity I hold, it's hard to break down<br>
        It's too late for apologies, It's going...<br>
        <p>
            Some things may break me<br>
            But always get back up<br>
            New perspective gained<br>
            From all of the pain and stress<br>
            And when I do come back<br>
            I’m stronger than ever before so<br>
            Kneel down<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Disturbing the peace<br>
            Look into my eyes<br>
            Now tell me the things you're blabbing about behind my back<br>
            The tenacity I hold, it's hard to break down<br>
            It's too late for apologies<br>
            It's going down.<br></p>
